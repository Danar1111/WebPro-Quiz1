                        <p>Mount Kelud is an active stratovolcano located in Kediri, East Java, Indonesia. Known for its historical eruptions and significant volcanic activity, it stands as one of the most iconic volcanoes in the country. Mount Kelud is characterized by a crater lake at its summit, which has been the source of devastating lahars (mudflows) during eruptions. Its most recent significant eruption occurred in 2014, spewing ash and volcanic material, which impacted nearby communities. Despite its potentially destructive nature, Mount Kelud also contributes to the fertility of the surrounding agricultural land due to its volcanic soil, making it a complex and important geological feature in the region. </p>
